# Langchain-Prompt-Engineering-model
The model showcases the use of the LangChain library with OpenAI's API to create NLP applications. It involves setting up language  models for tasks like advising, language translation, and text-based question answering. Each task is performed by defining a prompt  template and invoking the relevant chain.

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook, titled LangChain 101, serves as an introductory guide to leveraging LangChain in conjunction with OpenAI's language models. The notebook is designed for developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts who wish to explore how to build and deploy language models using LangChain's flexible framework.
